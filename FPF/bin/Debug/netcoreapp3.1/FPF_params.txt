#Specify decoy prefixes. Imply prefixes (PREFIX-) or suffixes (-SUFFIX) and separate by comma, e.g. REV_-, -_DECOY
#Imply "none" if there are no decoy proteins.
Decoy Prefixes or Suffixes: REV_-, -DECOY

#Specify keywords for standard proteins that should be excluded when calculating normalization ratios.
#Imply prefixes (PREFIX-) or suffixes (-SUFFIX) and separate by comma, e.g. -ALBU_BOVIN, NP-
#Imply "none" if all proteins are background and normalization is not needed.
Proteins to be Excluded from Normalization: -BARHE

#If a PSM falls within one of the ranges (including the lower boundary value) below, it should be removed.
#Use '-' to specify filter ranges, ',' to separate different ranges.
#For example, 2-5 or 1000-2000,3000-4000
#Ranges with no lower or upper limit is also available by leaving it blank. For example, 35-.
#If you choose not to specify filters of one feature, add # to the beginning of that line or imply "none".
#For example, #Charge: or Charge: none
#PTM Ratio is calculated by number of PTMs divided by peptide length
