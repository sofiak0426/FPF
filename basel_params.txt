#Specify keywords for background proteins for calculation normalization ratios.
#Imply prefixes (PREFIX-) or suffixes (-SUFFIX) and separate by comma, e.g -HUMAN, NP-

#If a PSM falls within one of the ranges (including the lower boundary value) below, it should be removed.
#Use - to specify filter ranges,to separate different ranges.
#For example, 2-5 or 1000-2000,3000-4000
#Ranges with no lower or upper limit is also available by leaving it blank. For example, 35-.
#If you choose not to specify filters of one feature, add # to the beginning of that line or imply "none".
#For example, #Charge: or Charge: none
#PTM Ratio is calculated by number of PTMs divided by peptide length
